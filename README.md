MMM-JellyNew
A MagicMirror¬≤ module that integrates with Jellyfin to display Now Playing media and Recently Added items.
Supports Movies, TV Shows, and Audio, and automatically fetches metadata, including Last.fm artist info for music.
This is a complete ground up rebuild becase..... well i hated the code. If any one out there would like to contribute feel free.
I still need to the lag in the progress bar update as there is an initial 30 second delay.
